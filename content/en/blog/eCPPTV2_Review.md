So when coming to the topic. This blog is divided into multiple sections:

1.  What is eCPPTv2?
2.  Should you take eCPPTv2?
3.  Is eCPPTv2 necessary?
4.  Why did I take eCPPTv2? What did I feel after completing the eCPPTv2 exam?
5.  Ultimate Preparation Guide for eCPPTv2!
6.  Final Words!


What is eCPPTv2?
================

[eCPPTv2](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ecpptv2-certification/) is a certification offered by vendor [eLearnSecurity](https://elearnsecurity.com). This certification certifies your skills on the below grounds:

*   Stack Based Windows BufferOverflows
*   Advanced Exploitation of Metasploit
*   Privilege Escalation and Persistence
*   Web Application exploitation
*   Reporting Writing Skills
*   Penetration Testing methodologies on Windows, Linux systems

Training is provided by the INE in a subscription-based model! Where you can purchase INE for a year with 750 US dollars. With this, you can not only prepare for eCPPTv2 but all the certifications provided by the INE. eLearnSecurity is a part of INE that consists of only a cybersecurity certification based company. INE consists of networking, programming‚Ä¶ sections and all the training is free if you purchase an INE subscription.

There are 3 pricing modules and since it is out of the scope. I'll just provide a link [https://ine.com/pages/plans](https://ine.com/pages/plans). And so after training, you should pay for the certification extra 400 US dollars for eCPPTv2.

When coming to the examination. You will get a letter of engagement from the eLearnSecurity where everything is specified on how to engage with the target and what are the requirements and things to be satisfied to pass the exam. It‚Äôs not like eJPT where you pentest network and answer the multiple-choice questions. Here you should perform a pentest on the whole networks specified in the Letter of Engagement and make a commercial-grade report on the network. You should specify every vulnerability you noticed in the report. The report should include Execution Summary, Impact of the vulnerability, CVE of the Vulnerability, Proof Of Concept (PoC), Remediation, Remediation Table at the end. You can include references if you would like to.

Finally, you should submit the report and it may take around a week or so to send you the results. Don‚Äôt worry they offer you a free retake if you fail the exam. And also you will get feedback from the examiner on why you have failed the exam and what you should improve

Should you take eCPPTv2?
========================

eCPPTv2 is a very good certification from which we can learn a lot of skills. As I said before this Certification proves you on various grounds. And it's too way practical and real-world where we pentest a target organisation and submit a commercial-grade report. This experience helps you in the real-world scenario and maybe even in the interviews. Experience is not just an experience we gain a new perspective of thinking and methodologies while doing it!

So should I pay 750$ and an extra 400$ for the certification? Here we should plan a little wiser move. I consider taking an INE subscription if your goal is not just eCPPTv2 but more certifications like if you want to complete not only eCPPTv2 but other certifications provided by eLearnSecurity or INE. And also I would recommend waiting for offers from INE like ‚ÄúBuy the subscription and get a free voucher worth 400$ from eLearnSecurity‚Äù. Even you get this offer I would recommend you to take more than one certification or at least prepare for another certification from the vendor.

Is eCPPTv2 necessary?
=====================

Here what I mean by necessary is usefulness in your career like helpful for getting a job. It is not that necessary. It helps in developing your skills, It was so famous among the Infosec community because of the way eLearnSecurity conducts the examination but not necessary because the problem is that it is not famous among the HRs and companies who hire us and that‚Äôs the problem, with the price of the certification exam, INE subscription there are so many certifications like OSCP which offer the same cost and those have greater return value than this. But if you are in a learning and want to invest money then I recommend INE because you can develop various skills here. Not only regarding eCPPTv2 but even all other stuff. Since eCPPTv2 is not necessary only invest in it if you want to develop your skills and learn different stuff ( not only eCPPTv2 )

Why did I take eCPPTv2? What did I feel after completing the eCPPTv2 exam?
==========================================================================

I completed PNPT Certification by Heath Adams (aka thecybermentor) and I‚Äôm searching for what to do next. I saw a video from JohnHammond on his eCPPTv2 review. In the video, He said that someone who completed eCPPTv2 is ready to take/purchase PWK. And my goal is to complete OSCP so I thought it would be better to take eCPPTv2 and eWPT from the INE and I got an email like if you purchase INE annual subscription you will get a free voucher worth 400$ from eLearnSecurity.

So as soon as I saw that I bought the voucher and prepared for the certification. After completing the exam I felt like this exam was super awesome and super complex. And definitely, you will gain something precious after the exam and that is the mindset of a penetration tester. Like on what to test, how to exploit, how to make a report on them. And I think I won't regret taking eCPPTv2

Ultimate Preparation Guide for eCPPTv2!
=======================================

Tip: Use msf5 for the exam. Have trouble downgrading it? use [https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali](https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali)

It‚Äôs going to be so big because I didn‚Äôt use INE much for the exam.

If you are a beginner with BOFs and pivoting these are my recommendations:

For Pivoting: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXOj56J5d64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXOj56J5d64)

For BOFs: [https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-buffer-overflows-for-oscp/](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-buffer-overflows-for-oscp/)

These helped me, the clarity and looks of the content may not be that great but the quality and the concepts these resources explain very well.

If you want a little basic and more good eye-looking content then go with the [TCM Buffer Overflow playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSnPayW6F7U&list=PLLKT__MCUeix3O0DPbmuaRuR_4Hxo4m3G) and after this make sure to complete all the things below

1\. PROXYCHAINS ‚Äî You will live in Proxychains during the exam. Know and understand how to use it. Revisit the lab that covers it. Anytime you‚Äôre in a lab that you pivot in, go back over it and use Proxychains to pivot.

2\. dostackoverflowgood ‚Äî Google this, and learn how to exploit it. I wish I had known about it before exam day, and it will pay dividends and save significant frustration.

3\. Ruby Exploitation Module ‚Äî If you have the Elite version of the course, skip forward and learn how to do BoF‚Äôs using Ruby. eLS does a shoddy job at teaching BoF‚Äôs in the System Security lessons, and this will help tremendously.

4\. Obscurities ‚Äî The exam has several other things it requires of you that aren‚Äôt covered well in the course. Page 77 of the WebApps lab, for instance, is most of what php coverage we have. Understand it and how it works.

5\. One-Liners ‚Äî Have some shell one-liners available for anything Linux you‚Äôll find. It‚Äôll help.

6\. Manual Exploitation ‚Äî There are opportunities to manually exploit that I found well before I figured out there was a Metasploit module for something. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take a shot on one of the thousands of exploitdb files you have on your machine, especially for privilege escalation.

7\. Windows Command Line Commands ‚Äî Know the command line commands for things like enabling Remote Desktop and disabling Firewalls. This not only will help during the exam but also in real-world engagements. And it‚Äôs just so much easier to move around on a Windows Desktop with admin privileges than it is to do the same in a command line.

8\. Cheat Sheet ‚Äî Fall back on your cheat sheet (YOU MADE A CHEAT SHEET, RIGHT?!?!?).

9\. Break Time ‚Äî Don‚Äôt forget to rest. Take breaks. This exam is difficult and stressful, especially if your experience comes from PTP only. Take some time for yourself and return fresh. Lightbulbs usually go off in your head.

Follow the above things and credit goes to [Joe Helle](https://medium.com/u/1ff785b4003f?source=post_page-----e23291c6c37e--------------------------------) for making my preparation for eCPPTv2 easier. I honestly didn't complete the whole INE material. Since I have a good experience with THM and BOFs.

Final Words!
============

I didn‚Äôt use INE for preparation !! I just followed the above steps! It‚Äôs up to you if you. I recommend following both what I said and INE because I just cant take responsibility if you fail in the exam. And make sure to improve your reporting skills!

If you are confident that you are well prepared go ahead and give the exam. Remember you have a free retake and go ahead.
